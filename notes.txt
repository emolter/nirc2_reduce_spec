# steps to reduce spectroscopic data according to pydis

1. Make combined bias frame by taking median of all bias frames, save it.

2. Median average flat frames as usual, and subtract bias frames

3. Flats were taken with grism and slit in position. Sum flat along spatial axis, smooth w/ 5pixel boxcar, take log of summed flux.
fit curve to these log(flux) vs wavelength data. take 10**fit. divide median averaged flat by this wavelength response curve. Save flat.

4. Do ArNeKrXe lamp spectrum fitting. The idea is to find the pixel location of peaks of known lines to produce a mapping between pixel and wavelength. End up with an array of same size as image but containing wavelengths. PyDis implements that interactively

5. Load science frame, subtract bias, divide by flat, convert into cts s-1

6. Extract science spectrum and apply wl solution

7. Make sky spectrum and apply wl solution

8. Subtract sky from science

9. Photometric calibration

NOTE THAT WAVELENGTH INCREASES FROM RIGHT TO LEFT ACROSS THE NIRC2 DETECTOR!
